# Exercise: Mock Server
### 1. Make the mock server return new column 'Quantity' and display in UI 

You can give any number to each item as its quantity.

It is highly recommanded to give one or more itmes( not all ) with quantity bigger than 104, e.g. 115, 1115.

### 2. Make the mock server filter response data

Make the mock server return items with quantity bigger than 104 only.

If none of the quantities in exercise 1 is bigger than 104, then 'No data' should display in UI as expected.
